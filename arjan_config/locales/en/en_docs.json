But not using a framework shouldn’t mean that other things (not related to design/dev) become more complicated. Arjan is a simple node js tool kit that helps you take your static (html/css/js) projects to production with the  minimum overhead, lowest cost, and best performance. Arjan features an easy to use CLI (made to resemble git) with intuitive commands for each tool in the kit. Because it is NOT a framework, Arjan basically has No barriers to entry.","Load_is_an_a68":"Load is an acronym for localize, optimize, audit, deploy. Four things that we repeatedly do to our static site projects. Since these four things aren’t related to the design or the development process of the website, they may fall outside of the expertise of a regular design firm causing a higher overhead. ","Arjan_uses_s69":"Arjan uses several popular node js modules and builds some functionalities on top/besides them to help you LOAD effectively, with 0 overhead. Its CLI is fast and easy to use/integrate into your current process.","the_purpose_72":"the purpose of the load workflow is to allow to continue doing what your doing (i.e. using HTML5, CSS3 and VanillaJS) and help you take your projects to production with the minimum amount of overhead. Avoid learning any new frameworks. Avoid having to constantly download and maintain many things at once. Avoid having to pay for a service to do all these things for you.","you_only_hav73":"you only have to do this once (when you install arjan for the first time). ","before_being74":"before being able to use arjan in a particular project you must:","when_you_run76":"when you run the init command (without the -g flag) it creates some directories and files inside your project. after that, each of the commands will also generate some directories/files. bellow is a depiction of how a simple project that only consists of an index.html file would look after its undergone the LOAD commands (localize, optimize, audit, deploy).  In th eexample the file was translated into spanish.","Arjan_Locali77":"Arjan Localize is node module for automatically localizing and translating html sites. It features a powerful CLI command that allows you to localize multiple pages into multiple languages with a single command. It has a modular API Since it can export content into popular formats like JSON and CSV, it may also work as a very basic content management solution for html sites.","Localization78":"Localization consists of adapting a product to a particular locality or region. Even though machine translation services like google translate and amazon translate have gotten impressively good, there still are several scenarios were manual intervention is needed. If you are expanding your digital product/service into a new region its important to get everything perfect. Complex grammar rules and slang often cause errors in the translation making some manual intervention or at least revision necessary. Also a project that has been correctly localized will have way better SEO. Additionally text content might not be the only thing that you want to localize; you might also need to use different images/videos and hyperlinks in your different versions.","A_common_pra79":"A common practice is to create JSON files called locales that container the text content of site/app. then instead of using words in your file you use variables that read from the locale object. This way content modification dont have to be made directly in the code. In genral this makes your internationalized project easier to maintain.","Arjan_uses_t80":"Arjan uses the id attributes already present in your html as the keys in the locale. The parser in arjan localize gets all the existing IDs of html elements with text content, and saves them in the locale. If the element didnt have an ID arjan automatically creates an ID for the object with the following format:  The first 12 characters of the text, replacing spaces with underscores and adding the translation index at the end.","Arjan_locali81":"Arjan localize also helps you to automatically translate your JSON locales and files in up to 54 different languages. It uses AWS’s neural machine translation system which is used in amazon.com. ","There’s_thre82":"There’s three ways in which you can use arjan localize. The three are listed bellow with their pros and cons.","the_translat85":"the translate command generates 2 or 3 things","Once_you_hav86":"Once you have translated your doc you can improve all of your translations by working directly on your neatly organized JSON locale files and running the translate command with the —update flag (-u).","Arjan_transl87":"Arjan translations is bi-directional meaning that you can also work on the output HTML files and then run the translate command with the —backwards (-b) flag to update your JSON files.","You_can_also88":"You can also generate a single CSV file with all the translations for your site by running the translate command with the —export flag (-e). if you use both the —export and —backwards flags you can update the CSV with site data. if you provide the filename arg only translations for that file will be included in the CSV.","The_example_90":"The example compares arjan with i18n; Lets suppose our input is an en.html file with the following content: ","After_runnin91":"After running the translate command we would get the following output:","Lets_suppose92":"Lets suppose that our input string didnt have an id attribute:","Notice_that_93":"Notice that an id with the first 12 characters of the string is created. Caps are lower-cased and spaces are replaced with underscores. A number with the index of the translations is inserted at the end (in case there’s another string that starts with the same 12 chars)","if_you_are_u94":"if you are using html5 elements in your page (nav, header, section, footer) you can add the html5 option in the translate command. This will generate objects with ids of html5 elements (nav, header, section, footer) and will insert translations as children of the object they belong to. suppose were still using the example above without ids:","Arjan_Optimi97":"Arjan Optimize helps you optimize all of your static assets with a single command. It takes into account several of the modern web dev directives and uses some of the most popular node modules for minification/compression of assets with a couple of neat features of its own.","Arjan_optimi99":"Arjan optimize scans your current directory recursively and for each file with a different module depending on the files MIME type.

","Often_times_105":"Often times when building a site, the page speed test is one of the last things we do. Sometimes theres a surprise and the score is not that good. To avoid these surprises you can use Arjan Audit in your dev process or even integrate it into your tests.","the_threshol108":"the threshold value is a number from 0 to 1 that represents your personal threshold for what you consider a decent enough site. the default is .8 (a B) 10 points above from this score is great, anything bellow isn't acceptable. this threshold value will filter out recommendations and add colors to your scores in the report.  ","Arjan_deploy111":"Arjan deploy is a tool that helps you deploy static websites to the AWS cloud using Cloudformation. The tool is modular and can be used with the Arjan CLI, or programmatically in your own node.js project. Arjan Deploy gives you several different options to deploy your static sites in AWS and it also helps you import existing AWS projects, or individual resources into your websites project.","It_turns_out112":"It turns out things get a bit trickier than expected when throwing in a CDN with HTTPS into the equation. As of now, to host a static site with HTTPS in AWS it requires more than one template and/or the use of multiple operations in the SDK.","Generally_st113":"Generally static sites in the cloud consist of an object storage solution (i.e. S3), a DNS (from your domain name provider or your cloud provider) a CDN or cache distribution network, and optionally may container a digital certificate. Arjan Gives you options to add the following resources to your stack depending on your needs. ","In_order_to_114":"In order to deploy a production site you must have already purchased a domain from a domain name registrar and you should have their respective interface open in order to create DNS records or transfer nameservers. there are several popular options out there; we like to use namecheap because as the name suggests it, its cheap, and it also has great service.","For_an_easie115":"For an easier development workflow we have defined some setups that include dev, test and prod (production). you can customize these by additionally providing flags.","Amazon_Route116":"Amazon Route 53 provides highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS), domain name registration, and health-checking web services. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like example.com into the numeric IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other.","AWS_Route53_117":"AWS Route53 has a $0.50/month cost (6$ a year). Its a better option than a standard DNS because:","You_can_only118":"You can only use an external DNS if you include the CDN option and exclude the route53 option. If you are using an external DNS a CNAME record pointing to the root will invalidate all other records pointing to the root; so if you have other records pointing to your root, for example mail exchange (MX) records to send/receive email with your custom domain you will have to perform some additional steps.","Instead_of_p119":"Instead of pointing the CNAME record to the root, you can point to the CNAME to the www subdomain.
